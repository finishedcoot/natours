# Natours Application
Natours is a project that I built with help of a course that I took about node.js, it is made with express, mongodb(mongoose), axios, jwt authentication,and some general libraries for its security, it is very feature rich platform, its like a tour agancy, with customers, tour guids and admin, you can sort tours in many ways, e.g. this month 5 top tours, many of them made with different tools of mongodb.



Built using modern technologies: node.js, express, mongoDB, mongoose
